# je lis trop

je lis trop is a books newsletter I created in December 2020.

Reading has been my biggest hobby from the early age â€“ I am a voracious reader, who rushes to read as much as she can, and this project was born out of my appreciation for the different authors, their perspectives, and their stories.

I always knew I would like this newsletter to have a certain look. I was not entirely happy with the email templates proposed by Mailchimp (especially how the padding/margins looked on mobile versions), so I set myself a challenge to redesign and implement my own code.

**Deployed version**: https://jelistrop.superhi.com/
