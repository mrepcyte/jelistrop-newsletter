                        particular time. rather than straightforward recommendations, it is a list
                        of fragments and associations, most of them quite personal.

                When the festive season ends, there's a certain longing that lasts – longing for
                warmth, comfort, richness of color. I find the Christmas chaos disorienting, not to
                be missed when it’s over. But I do want to retain small glimmers of it. I am
                thinking of colorful candy wrappers, a pile of books, aroma of a vanilla cake and
                cocoa powder, a handmade postcard with just a few words scribbled on it, a gifted
                bottle of fresh, floral perfume, placed in a cabinet among other bottles, and the
                trail that perfume leaves on a woolen scarf… (I like the contrast – the smell of
                flowers and mandarins, oozing in the landscape of snowy days).
            </p>
            <p class="text-container">
                I used to be fascinated by the beginning of the new year; this fascination is much
                weaker now, although I still feel an obligation to give it a thought or two on the
                last day. It’s an echo to the past when I’d write a detailed summary of the year
                that ended, analyzing every memory, situation, achievement. I have replaced
                summaries with short conclusions and do not overthink my goals. When January starts,
                I see it as a pale, mute month; time better fitted for slow starts than imposing
                plans. For now, I do nothing more than hold on to small, inconsequential things. I
                could be noticing a sugary scent of oatmeal porridge travelling through the café. It
                happened when I was waiting for a friend; it lasted just a moment, just a fraction
                of it, but I keep thinking about it. I could be looking at a notebook with a fairy
                on the cover, figure surrounded by animals, hair falling in golden waves. It was so
                sweet, childish-like; I saw it in a foreign city and thought it would be perfect to
                write dreams in. Or I could be thinking about the fashion documentary I recently
                watched, approximately one hour and forty minutes of gazing at marvelous confections
                on the screen.

                Literature classics, with their polished language and imagery, can usually bring
                that kind of contentment. Last January,
                <span class="author">Jane Austen</span>'s <span class="book-title">Emma</span> kept
                me company, this year it's <span class="author">Edith Wharton</span>'s
                <span class="book-title">House of Mirth</span>. To be fair,
                <span class="book-title">Emma</span> is a much lighter book; playful, innocent.
                Emma, a confident young lady, navigates the social life with little reserve and
                causes trouble with her games of matchmaking. But things fall into place, Emma gets
                her happy ending, and the reader closes the book with a conviction that only good
                things will happen to her. Society games in
                <span class="book-title">The House of Mirth</span> are of entirely different sort –
                much more ominous and unpredictable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-container">
                <span class="book-title">The House of Mirth</span> is about a desire to attain
                beautiful things – to be surrounded with them, to live among them. Comfortable,
                luxurious living is the end goal. Lily Bart, the woman at the heart of the story, is
                an idealist, fond of pictures and flowers, sentimental fiction, persuaded that her
                impeccable taste ennobles “her desire for worldly advantages”. At twenty-nine, she’s
                not married yet. To have all those worldly advantages, she should be. Lily thinks
                that with a little bit of wisdom and effort she can win her place among those who do
                not have any material worries and live securely in a shelter of abundance. However,
                in the society of those times (the book was published in 1905), society of
                “cosmopolitan pleasure-seekers”, the smallest misstep or misunderstanding amounts to
                a scandal and a scandal amounts to the end of all aspirations. Despite her delicacy
                and despite the graceful image she’s presenting to the malicious public eye, Lily
                gets entangled in questionable relationships and her chances of finding way back are
                growing smaller with every page. I don’t think there was another literary character
                for whom I had wished a happier ending more desperately than for Lily Bart.

                In further pursuit of beauty, and perhaps something a little more modern, a little
                less tragic, I thought I was bound to find it in a book where sentences are full of
                yellow blossoms and white aprons, coffee and marmalade jars, cuchuflís with caramel
                and sandwiches, orange juice and French toast, lemons, plums, tangerines; where
                sentences are colored by the shades of a tropical sunset, orange moon, silken warm
                water. The book I'm writing about –
                <span class="author">Lucia Berlin</span>'s
                <span class="book-title">Evening in Paradise</span> – is a rare example of haunting
                beauty. I did not know a single thing about Lucia before reading this collection of
                short stories, but the introduction written by her oldest son and some additional
                reading on the side painted a picture of a stylish, rebellious woman, who led an
                unconventional life. Three marriages with different artists, four sons, frequent
                relocations, changing cities and countries – just a couple of paragraphs on her life
                are enough to make one’s head spin.

                The stories collected in
                <span class="book-title">Evening in Paradise</span> reflect her personality and are
                based on her recollections. They take place in Paris (France), Santiago (Chile),
                Yelapa (Mexico), and then all over the United States – New York, of course, El Paso
                in Texas, Albuquerque in New Mexico (the only reason I know Albuquerque is because
                it’s tied to the world of Breaking Bad; it was a pleasant surprise to find this city
                in the pages of a book and add similarly eerie, only literary associations on top).
                What we see in these cities: Girls spending their nights under the blanket of stars,
                the glamorous spectacle of motorcycle races, Hollywood celebrities in bars, women
                tending to their plants and bathing their children. I was right, in a way, by
                assuming I will find beauty here – it’s in all these dazzling details I only hinted
                at above. But the stories are dark and unsettling, attesting to the strangeness or
                even morbidity of relationships. Stars disappear in the rain, races end in
                spectacular tragedies, celebrities witness unsavory fights, and women struggle to
                find any meaning in their everyday motions. The allure of Lucia Berlin’s work lies
                in her storytelling abilities, and it’s a relief to know that this book I randomly
                picked off the library shelf is not even her most famous one.

                <span class="book-title">The House of Mirth</span> and
                <span class="book-title">Evening in Paradise</span> are gorgeous books. I wanted to
                start the year writing about them both, but I also wanted to include a positive,
                purely joyful kind of book – not ignoring the complexity of human life, but
                deliberately focusing on the good. And yet I haven’t come up with anything that
                could fit one hundred percent into this category. There is always Proust, of course.
                Fashion books can also serve this purpose nicely, but I’m planning on mentioning one
                in the next essay. I have recently started reading
                <span class="author">Goliarda Sapienza</span>'s
                <span class="book-title">Meeting in Positano</span> and I wonder if it could be that
                kind of story. Under the sun of Amalfi coast, in the pink light of Positano
                mountains, an actress from Rome meets a mysterious “princess” of the resort. The
                rest of the story should be focused on the development of their unexpected
                friendship, and judging from the first chapters, I expect that story to be full of
                charming sights as well as details from Italian history and culture.
